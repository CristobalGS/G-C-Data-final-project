In the first place it tidies up the data adding variable columns (subject, set, activity) and selects only measurments for the mean and standard deviation of the original variables. It does that for both the test and train set, and then merges both data set together ("data" dataframe). 

It generates a new data set (final.data) summarizing the first one by taken the mean of each variable over subject and activity.
